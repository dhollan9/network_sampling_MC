***Compiling***

If you have all the prerequisites, you only need to use the command

  make

to compile the program.

***Prerequisites***

You will need a C/C++ compiler, such as g++. 

An install of gcc will produce compilers in a directory such as /opt/local/bin/
the Makefile is defaulted to a specific version, g++-mp-6. This can be changed to g++ or any other version.


This code requires the following libraries

This code requires the following libraries:

Linux systems:
libgsl
libgfortran
libm
libblas
libstdc++

libblas may be replaced with libg2c if you do not have it, but you must change the Makefile (change all instances of -lblas to -lg2c)

Mac systems:
libgsl
libgfortran
libm
libquadmath
libstdc++

1. libm is usually in /usr/lib
2. libgsl must be installed, the Makefile will find it automatically once it is installed.
3. libgfortran, libquadmath, and libstdc++ should all be in the same place. An install of gcc will put them in a directory such as
/opt/local/lib/gcc6 (for version gcc6). 



The Windows command line does not use bash, and thus you must have a GNU tool if you wish to run this code on a Windows machine.

If you have a library installed but the Makefile cannot find it, try adding the library path to the LIBS variable. An example path is
-L/usr/local/lib
The Makefile will search this folder for any relevant libraries.
